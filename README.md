 #### By the end of this project :
 - In olden Days Farmers used to figure the ripeness of soil and influenced suspicious to develop
 which to kind of yield.
 - They didn't think about the humidity, level of water and especially climate condition
 which terrible a farmer increasingly.
- The Internet of things (IOT) is re-modeling the agribusiness
 empowering the agriculturists through the extensive range of strategies, for example, accuracy as well as
 practical farming to deal with challenges in the field.
- IOT utilize farmers to get related with his residence
 from wherever and atÂ whateverÂ point.

 ## Introduction : <picture> <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f38a/512.gif" alt="ðŸŽŠ" width="30" height="30"></picture>
Smart farming is performing agricultural operations smartly with more precision, and it relies on the use of the Internet of Things (loT) and Artificial Intelligence (Al). Smart agriculture addresses many issues related to crop production as it allows monitoring of the changes in climatic factors, temperature, humidity, etc.
  

## Common threats of Agriculture : <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Exploding%20Head.png" alt="Exploding Head" width="25" height="25" /> 

1. Agriculture is the root to countryâ€™s economic development. In recent times, huge scientific advancement
has been implemented in various agricultural fields for the betterment of the future. 

2. Despite of various researches,proper assessment and productivity couldnâ€™t be reached. The Agriculture Parameters are utilizing an IOT Technology and system availability that draw in these objects to assemble and deal information. 

3. The IOT enables things selected recognized or potentially forced remotely crosswise over completed the process of existing configuration, manufacture open gateways for all the additional obvious merge of the substantial earth into PC based frameworks, in addition to acknowledging overhauled capacity, precision and cash interconnected favoured stance.

4. Precisely when IOT is extended with sensors and actuators, the improvement modifies into an occasion of
the all the extra wide category of electronic physical structures, which in like manner incorporates headways, for
instance, clever grids, splendid homes, canny moving and smartÂ urbanÂ groups.
